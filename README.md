# TensorFlow_Practice_Specialization

This specialization was achieved from deeplearning.ai on Coursera.
I have discovered and become familiar with the tools used by software developers to build scalable AI-powered algorithms in TensorFlow, which is a popular open-source machine learning framework.

In this course specialization, I have explored exciting opportunities for AI applications. We started by developing understanding on how to build and train neural networks. We emphasized on improving a networkâ€™s performance using convolutions while training it to identify real-world images. In addition, I have learned how to teach machines to understand, analyze, and predict sequences and timeseries. Learn to process sequences and timeseries as vectors, and input them to a neural network with windowing techniques. We developed DNNs, RNNs, LSTMs and CNNs models on timeseries and sequences and learned how to combine them to improve model performance. 

This course was essential to build up TensorFlow skills I needed to tackle a wide range of problems and projects.
