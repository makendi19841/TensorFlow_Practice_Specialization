# TensorFlow_Practice_Specialization

This specialization was achived from deeplearning.ai on Coursera.
I have discovered and become familiar with the tools used by software developers to build scalable AI-powered algorithms in TensorFlow, which is a popular open-source machine learning framework.

In this course Specialization, I have explored exciting opportunities for AI applications. We started by developing understanding of how to build and train neural networks. We emphasized on improving a networkâ€™s performance using convolutions while training it to identify real-world images. In addition, I have learned how to teach machines to understand, analyze, and predict sequences and timeseries. Learn to process sequences and timeseries as vectors, and input data to a neural network. 

This course have surely built up TensorFlow skills I needed to tackle a wide range of problems and projects.
